# a number is can be an int (integer) or a float (decimal)

# Ex 1:

decimal = 1.5

# Ex 2:

whole_number = 11

# you can use calculations with numbers 

# Ex 1:
# the calculation can produce either a float or int
print(25 * 68 + 13 / 28) 

# Ex 2:
# calculation can update variables 

quilt_width = 8
quilt_length = 12

# we update the length to 8
quilt_length = 8

# original output: 96
# output: 64
squares = quilt_width * quilt_length
print("squares: " + squares)

# Arithmetic Operators 

#exponent 
exponent = 6 ** 2

#modulo takes the remainder from a division calculation 
moduolo = 3 % 3 # ouputs 0 because 3 / 3 = 1 aka no remainder
